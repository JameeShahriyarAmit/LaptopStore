This project is an online commerce store for laptops. There are two types of users which are Staff and 
Customer. Depending on which user logs in, the functions will be different. If Staff logs in, they are
able to add, update, and delete the products in the store. If Customer logs in, they are able to view
all the products and then buy the products. The database will store all the necessary information.
